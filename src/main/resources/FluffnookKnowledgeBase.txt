The Fluffnook is a small, rabbit-sized mammal native to the misty highlands of the fictional Veridian Mountains. Standing approximately 12 inches tall and weighing 3-4 pounds, this creature is covered in dense, iridescent fur that shifts from deep purple to silver depending on the angle of light. The Fluffnook's most distinctive feature is its oversized, luminescent ears that can rotate 180 degrees and glow with a soft blue light during twilight hours. These nocturnal creatures are herbivorous, feeding primarily on moonbell flowers and crystalline moss that grows on volcanic rocks. Fluffnooks are known for their exceptional memory - they can recall the exact location of food sources for up to seven years and have been observed creating intricate mental maps of their territory spanning over 50 square miles. They live in small family groups of 4-6 individuals and communicate through a series of melodic chirps that can be heard up to two miles away on clear nights. The average lifespan of a Fluffnook is 25-30 years, and they reproduce only once every three years, typically giving birth to twins during the spring equinox.
